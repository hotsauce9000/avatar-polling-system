# GIT
Now, based on your knowledge of the project, commit all changed files now in a series of logically connected groupings with super detailed commit messages for each and then push. Take your time to do it right. Don't edit the code at all. Don't commit obviously ephemeral files. Use ultrathink.

## GIT BUMP
Do all the GitHub stuff: commit, deploy, create tag, bump version, release, monitor gh actions, compute checksums, etc.
