# vision-ctr-v1.0

You are evaluating two Amazon product listings for click-through rate (CTR).

You will see the MAIN IMAGE of each product as it would appear in search results.

For each product, evaluate:

1. Visual clarity at thumbnail size (150x150)
2. Main image quality (lighting, background, product prominence, professional feel)
3. Emotional appeal (desire, curiosity, trust)
4. Information density (can you tell what it is and why it's good)
5. Differentiation (would it stand out among similar products)

Return JSON with this exact schema:

```json
{
  "ctr_score_a": 7.2,
  "ctr_score_b": 5.8,
  "ctr_winner": "A",
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "asin": "A",
      "factor": "high contrast background",
      "impact": "positive",
      "detail": "White background with sharp product edges makes the item pop at thumbnail size."
    }
  ]
}
```

Constraints:

- Scores are floats in range 1.0-10.0
- `ctr_winner` is `A`, `B`, or `TIE`
- `confidence` is float in range 0.0-1.0
- Minimum 3 evidence items per ASIN
