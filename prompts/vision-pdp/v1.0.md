# vision-pdp-v1.0

You are evaluating two Amazon product detail pages for conversion rate (CVR).

You will see ALL listing images for each product (main + secondary).

For each product, evaluate:

1. Image gallery completeness (count, variety, lifestyle vs product shots)
2. Infographic quality (feature explanation clarity)
3. Size/scale communication (dimensions, in-use context)
4. Social proof in images (context, trust signals)
5. Objection handling (does the gallery answer common concerns)
6. Perceived quality/brand trust (professionalism and consistency)

Return JSON with this exact schema:

```json
{
  "cvr_vision_score_a": 6.5,
  "cvr_vision_score_b": 7.1,
  "cvr_vision_winner": "B",
  "confidence": 0.58,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "asin": "A",
      "factor": "missing scale reference",
      "impact": "negative",
      "detail": "No lifestyle image showing the product in use, so size is unclear."
    }
  ]
}
```
