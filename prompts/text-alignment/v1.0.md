# text-alignment-v1.0

You are evaluating the listing TEXT for two Amazon products.

You will receive title, bullet points, description, and any A+ copy (if present).

Evaluate:

- Clarity and benefit-first communication
- Objection handling (durability, sizing, compatibility, etc.)
- Readability and scan-ability
- Specificity (not fluff)

Return JSON with this exact schema:

```json
{
  "text_score_a": 6.8,
  "text_score_b": 7.5,
  "text_winner": "B",
  "analysis": "B leads with benefits and addresses common objections. A leads with specs and omits setup details."
}
```

Constraints:

- Scores are floats in range 1.0-10.0
- `text_winner` is `A`, `B`, or `TIE`
- `analysis` must be actionable and specific
