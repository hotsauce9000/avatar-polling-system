# Golden Tests

Golden tests are fixed listing pairs with expected winners/scores used to detect drift.

Current fixture:

- `golden_tests/fixtures/golden_pair_001.json`

Execution commands are maintained in one place:

- `docs/runbooks/testing.md`

This suite is intended to be a release gate for deterministic verdict stability.
